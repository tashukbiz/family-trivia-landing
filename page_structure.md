**Does Family Game Night End in Complaints?**

**Copy:**
Most trivia games simply aren’t built for mixed ages:

- Kids struggle because questions are too hard
- Adults lose interest because they’re too easy
- Siblings argue
- Grandparents get left behind
- And questions repeat quickly

The result?
More frustration than fun.

**Highlight Box (Glass Panel, Floating Icons):**

### **Each Player Chooses:**
