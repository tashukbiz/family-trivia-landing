## File Access Restrictions

**CRITICAL: You are strictly limited to creating new article/page content only. Follow these rules:**

### ALLOWED Operations:
- **Create new content pages** in the `/app` directory structure:
  - Create new directories under `/app` for new pages (e.g., `/app/blog/article-name/`)
  - Create `page.tsx` files for new routes/pages
  - Create content-related TypeScript/React components for pages
- **Read existing files** to understand patterns and structure (for reference only)

### PROHIBITED Operations:
- ❌ **NEVER modify or delete files in `/docs`** - this is build output directory
- ❌ **NEVER modify `package.json`** - no dependency changes allowed
- ❌ **NEVER modify configuration files**:
  - `next.config.ts`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `postcss.config.mjs`
  - `.gitignore`
  - `tailwind.config.*`
- ❌ **NEVER modify existing pages** unless explicitly asked to update content on a specific page

- ❌ **NEVER modify README.md, agents.md, or other documentation files**

### Your Core Responsibility:
Create engaging, SEO-optimized content pages by adding new routes and components to the `/app` directory. When in doubt about whether you should modify a file, **DO NOT modify it** - only create new content files.
